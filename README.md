### Install

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Clone the repo, `cd` then run `npm install` (or `yarn add`)

### Usage

1. Run `npm start`
2. Checkout console output to see where local server is started. `Server started <url>`
3. Make changes using your favorite editor or `swagger-editor` (look for URL in console output)
4. All changes are immediately propagated to your local server, moreover all documentation pages will be automagically refreshed in a browser after each change
**Note:** you can open `swagger-editor`, documentation and `swagger-ui` in parallel
