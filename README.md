## To work on the API specification

### Install

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Clone the repo, `cd` then run `npm install` (or `yarn add`)

### Usage

1. Run `npm start`
2. Check the console output to see where the local server was started. For example: `Server started http://localhost:3000`
3. Make changes using your favorite editor (in the `/spec` folder) or use the bundled `swagger-editor` (look for the URL in console output)
4. All changes are immediately propagated to your local server, moreover all documentation pages will be automagically refreshed in the browser after each change
**Note:** you can open `swagger-editor`, documentation and `swagger-ui` in parallel
5. Once you finish with the changes you can run tests using: `npm test`
